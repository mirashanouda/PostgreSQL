# PostgreSQL
In this project, I will be modifying the database management system structure for PostgreSQL. Mainly, I will be modifying the buffer management policy and the various Join operator algorithms.

## Starting the Database
To start the database, 2 consoles are needed to run the following commands in  `project/install/`

- Execute the backend: 
    - `bin/postgres -D data`
- Execute the psql console: 
    - `bin/psql -h localhost ProjectDB`
